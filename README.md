## 👋 About Me

I am a passionate researcher specializing in power systems, with a focus on data-driven modeling, optimization, and control of inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs). My research interests revolve around applying Reinforcement Learning and Generative AI to power system dynamics, and I am currently exploring the control and dynamics of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following (GFM/GFL) inverters.

With a strong background in Electrical Engineering, I have over five years of combined experience in academia and industry, contributing to projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and international research collaborations.
